Description: Make-it-easy-pipeline (MIEP) is an integrated, interactive, and 
	user-friendly R package that aggregates a high number of tools for 
	the analysis of RNA-seq data. The development of MIEP's pipeline is 
	based on the following idea: Since pathway disruption plays 
	a critical role in cancer development by affecting the signaling 
	mechanisms that rule cell function, focusing on gene sets mimicking 
	pathways can accelerate the development and testing of treatments acting 
	on key elements of signal transduction. MIEP pipeline develops and edits 
	new gene sets based on the results of multiple integrated analyses.
